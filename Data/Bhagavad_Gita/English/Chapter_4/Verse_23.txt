=== Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 4, Verse 23 ===


गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतस: |
यज्ञायाचरत: कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते || 23 ||

gata-saṅgasya muktasya jñānāvasthita-chetasaḥ
yajñāyācharataḥ karma samagraṁ pravilīyate


== Word Meanings ==

gata-saṅgasya — free from material attachments
muktasya — of the liberated
jñāna-avasthita — established in divine knowledge
chetasaḥ — whose intellect
yajñāya — as a sacrifice (to God)
ācharataḥ — performing
karma — action
samagram — completely
pravilīyate — are free


== Translation ==

They are released from the bondage of material attachments and their intellect is established in divine knowledge. Since they perform all actions as a sacrifice (to God), they are freed from all karmic reactions.


== Commentary ==

In this verse, Lord Krishna summarizes the conclusion of the previous five verses. Dedication of all one’s actions to God results from the understanding that the soul is eternal servitor of God. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: jīvera svarūpa haya kṛiṣhṇera nitya-dāsa (Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela, 20.108)[v18] “The soul is by nature the servant of God.” Those who are established in this knowledge perform all their actions as an offering to him and are released from the sinful reactions of their work.
What is the kind of vision that such souls develop? Shree Krishna explains this in the next verse.
