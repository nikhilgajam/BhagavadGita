== Commentary ==

The Vedic scriptures repeatedly describe God as an ocean of unlimited divine bliss:
ānando brahmeti vyajānāt   (Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 3.6)
“Know God to be bliss.”
kevalānubhavānanda svarūpaḥ parameśhvaraḥ   (Bhagavatam 7.6.23)
“God’s form is made of pure bliss.”
ānanda mātra kara pāda mukhodarādi   (Padma Purāṇ)
“God’s hands, feet, face, stomach, etc. are all made of bliss.”
jo ānand sindhu sukharāsī   (Ramayan)
“God is an ocean of bliss and happiness.”
All these mantras and verses from the scriptures emphasize that divine bliss is the nature of God’s personality.  The yogi, who absorbs the senses, mind, and intellect in God, begins to experience the infinite bliss of God who is seated within
