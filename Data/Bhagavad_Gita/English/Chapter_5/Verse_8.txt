== Translation ==

Those steadfast in karm yog, always think, “I am not the doer,” even while engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, excreting, grasping, and opening or closing the eyes. With the light of divine knowledge, they see that it is only the material senses that are moving amongst their objects.


== Commentary ==

Whenever we accomplish anything substantial, we are overcome with the pride that we have done something great.  The pride of being the doer of one’s actions is a stumbling block to rising beyond material consciousness.  However, the God-conscious karm yogis overcome this obstacle with ease.  With purified intellect, they see themselves as separate from the body, and hence they do not attribute their bodily actions to themselves.  The body is made from the material energy of God, and thus they attribute all their works as done by the power of God.  Since they have surrendered to the will of God, they depend upon Him to inspire their mind and intellect in accordance with His divine will.  So, they remain situated in the understanding that God is the doer of everything.
The Sage Vasishth advised Lord Ram:
kartā bahirkartāntarloke vihara rāghava   (Yog Vāsiṣhṭh)
“O Ram, externally engage in actions diligently, but internally practice to see yourself as the non-doer and God as the prime mover of all your activities.”  In this divine consciousness, the karm yogis see themselves as mere instruments in the hands of God.  Shree Krishna explains in the following verse the consequences of work done in this consciousness.
