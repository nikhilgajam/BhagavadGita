== Commentary ==

In these verses, Shree Krishna gives a glimpse into the various aspects of His infinite personality.  Kratu means yajña (sacrifice), such as agnihotra yajñas mentioned in the Vedas.  It also refers to the yajñas, such as vaiśhva deva that are described in the Smṛiti scriptures.  Auṣhadham refers to the potency in medicinal herbs.
Creation emanates from God, and hence He is its Pitā (Father).  Before creation, He holds the unmanifested material energy in His womb, and so He is also its Mātā (Mother).  He maintains the universe and nourishes it, and thus He is its Dhātā (Sustainer).  He is also the Father of Brahma, who is the creator, and hence, He is the Grandfather of this universe.
The Vedas have emanated from God.  The Ramayan states:  jākī sahaja svāsa śhruti chārī  “God manifested the Vedas by His breath.”  They are the knowledge potency of God, and hence an aspect of His unlimited personality.  Shree Krishna states this truth dramatically by saying that He is the Vedas.
