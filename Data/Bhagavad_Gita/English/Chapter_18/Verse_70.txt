== Commentary ==

Shree Krishna had repeatedly told Arjun to surrender his intellect to him (verses 8.7, 12.8). This does not imply that we stop using the intellect; rather it means we utilize our intellect to the best of our ability in fulfilling his will for us. From the message of the Bhagavad Gita we understand what his will is. Hence, those who study this sacred dialogue worship God with their intellect.
