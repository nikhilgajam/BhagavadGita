== Commentary ==

Shree Krishna Dwaipayan Vyasadev, also known as Sage Ved Vyas, was the spiritual master of Sanjay. By the grace of his Guru, Sanjay had been blessed with the power of clairvoyance, to know all that transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra while he sat in the royal palace of Hastinapur. Here, Sanjay acknowledges it was by his Guru’s mercy that he got the opportunity to hear the supreme science of Yog from the Lord of Yog himself, Shree Krishna.
Ved Vyas, the author of the Brahma Sūtras, the Puraṇas, the Mahabharat, etc. was a descension of God, and possessed all the clairvoyant powers himself. Thus, he not only heard the conversation between Shree Krishna and Arjun, but also the one between Sanjay and Dhritarasthra. Thereby, he included both conversations while compiling the Bhagavad Gita.
