== Commentary ==

Shree Krishna is now concluding the topic of his opulences. From verses 20 to 39, he has described 82 of his infinite opulences. He now says that he has spoken only one portion (uddeśhataḥ) of the breadth of the topic (vistāraḥ).
The question can be asked that if everything is the opulence of God, then what was the need of mentioning these? The answer is that Arjun had asked Shree Krishna how he should think of him, and these glories have been described in response to Arjun’s question. The mind is naturally drawn to specialties, and thus, the Lord has revealed these specialties amongst his powers. Whenever we see a special splendor manifesting anywhere, if we look on it as God’s glory, then our mind will naturally be transported to him. In the larger scheme of things, however, since God’s glories are in all things big and small, one can think of the whole world as providing innumerable examples for enhancing our devotion. A paint company in India would advertise, “Whenever you see colors think of us.” In this case, Shree Krishna’s statement is tantamount to saying, “Wherever you see a manifestation of glory, think of me.”
