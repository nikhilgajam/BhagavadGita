== Commentary ==

Shree Krishna continues naming the most magnificent in each category to reveal his glories to Arjun. Ucchaihshrava is a celestial winged-horse that belongs to Indra, the king of the celestial abodes. It is white in color and is the fastest horse in the universe. It emerged during the pastime of the churning of the ocean by devas (celestial gods) and asuras (demons). Airavata is a white elephant that serves as the vehicle of Indra. It is also called ardha-mātang, or “the elephant of the clouds.”
