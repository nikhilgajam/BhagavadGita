== Commentary ==

Anant is the divine serpent on whom Lord Vishnu rests. He possesses ten thousand hoods. It is said that he has been describing the glories of God with each of his hoods since the beginning of creation, but the description has not yet been completed.
Varun is the celestial god of the ocean. Aryama is the third son of Aditi. He is worshipped as the head of the departed ancestors. Yamraj is the celestial god of death. He arranges to take the soul from its mortal frame after death. He dispenses justice on behalf of God for the soul’s actions in this life, granting punishment or reward in the next life. He does not deviate an inch from his duties though they may be gruesome and painful. He reflects the glory of God as the perfect dispenser of justice.
