== Commentary ==

Arjun says, “O Omnipresent Lord, you are pervading in all ten directions, the whole earth, the sky above, and the space in-between. All living beings are shuddering in fear of you.” Why should the three worlds shudder before the universal form when they have not even seen it? Arjun implies that everyone is functioning in fear of God’s laws. His edicts are in place, and everyone is obliged to submit to them.
karama pradhāna bisva kari rākhā, jo jasa karai so tasa phala chākhā  (Ramayan)[v4]
“The world functions according to the law of karma. Whatever we do, we will have to reap the karmic results.” Like the law of karma, there are innumerable laws in existence. Many scientists make a living out of discovering and theorizing the physical laws of nature, but they can never make the laws. God is the supreme law-maker, and everyone is subject to the dominion of his laws.
