== Commentary ==

Arjun addresses Shree Krishna as the original Divine Person, the cause of all causes. Every object and every personality has a cause, or a source, from which it came into being. Even Lord Vishnu has a cause. Although he is also a form of God, he is an expansion of Shree Krishna. However, Shree Krishna is not the expansion of any personality. He is the causeless first cause of everything that exists. Hence, Brahma prays to him:
īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhaṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥ
anādirādi govindaḥ sarva kāraṇa kāraṇam (Brahma Samhitā 5.1)[v12]
“Shree Krishna is the original form of the Supreme Lord. His personality is full of knowledge and Bliss. He is the origin of all, but he is without origin. He is the cause of all causes.”
Shree Krishna is omniscient—the knower of everything. Further, he is also the object of all knowledge. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (4.29.49) states: sā vidyā tanmatir yayā [v13]“True knowledge is that which helps us know God.” Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:
jo hari sevā hetu ho, soī karm bakhān
jo hari bhagati baṛhāve, soī samujhiya jñāna (Bhakti Śhatak verse 66)[v14]
“Whatever work is done in the service of God, know that truly to be karm. Whatever knowledge enhances our love for God, know that to be true jñāna.” Hence, Shree Krishna is both the knower and the object of knowledge.
