== Commentary ==

Arjun is seeing here the kāla rūp of Shree Krishna, i.e. his form as all-devouring time. The marching onslaught of time consumes even the greatest of personalities, including the celestial gods. Arjun sees them entering the universal form, with folded hands, in subservience to the kāla rūp of God. At the same time, he sees the sages and perfected souls, extolling the Lord with their thoughts, words, and deeds.
