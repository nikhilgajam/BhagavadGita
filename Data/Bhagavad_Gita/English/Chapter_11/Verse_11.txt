== Translation ==

In that cosmic form, Arjun saw unlimited faces and eyes, decorated with many celestial ornaments and wielding many kinds of divine weapons. He wore many garlands on His body and was anointed with many sweet-smelling heavenly fragrances. He revealed Himself as the wonderful and infinite Lord whose face is everywhere.


== Commentary ==

Sanjay elaborates upon Shree Krishna’s divine universal form with the words aneka (many) and anant (unlimited). The entire creation is the body of God’s cosmic form, and therefore it contains countless faces, eyes, mouths, shapes, colors, and forms. The human intellect is habituated to grasping things within the limited kernel of time, space, and form. The cosmic form of God revealed unusual wonders, marvels, and miracles in all directions, transcending the limitations of space and time, and thus it could be aptly termed as wondrous.
