Arjun said: O Master of the senses, it is but apt that the universe rejoices in giving You praise and is enamored by You. Demons flee fearfully from You in all directions and hosts of perfected saints bow to You.


== Commentary ==

In this verse and the next ten, Arjun eulogizes Shree Krishna’s glories from various perspectives. He uses the word sthāne, meaning “it is but apt.” It is but natural that the people of a kingdom who accept the sovereignty of their king delight in glorifying him. It is also natural that those who harbor enmity toward the king fear him and flee from his presence. And it is natural for the king’s retinue of ministers to be deeply devoted to him. Arjun draws a parallel to this, saying that it is only appropriate that the world glorifies their Supreme Lord, the demons become frightened of him, and the saintly personalities offer devotional prayers to him.
