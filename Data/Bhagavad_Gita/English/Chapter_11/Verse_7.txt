Behold now, Arjun, the entire universe, with everything moving and non-moving, assembled together in My universal form. Whatever else you wish to see, observe it all within this universal form.


== Commentary ==

After hearing Shree Krishna’s instructions to behold his form, Arjun wonders where to see it. So Shree Krishna states that it is within the body of the Supreme Divine Personality. There, he will see infinite universes with all their moving and non-moving entities. Every entity exists in the universal form, and so do the events of the past and the future. Arjun will thus be able to see the victory of the Pandavas and the defeat of the Kauravas as an event that is a part of the unfoldment of the cosmic plan for the universe.
