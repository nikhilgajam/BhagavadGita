== Commentary ==

Arjun says that Shree Krishna is the greatest and the senior most. The father is always senior to the son. Shree Krishna is the father of the father… of all the fathers that exist. Similarly, he is the spiritual master of the spiritual master… of all the spiritual masters that are present. The first spiritual master was the creator Brahma, who passed on the knowledge to his disciple, and so on. However, Brahma received the Vedic knowledge from Shree Krishna. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (1.1.1) states: tene brahma hṛidāya ādi kavaye [v20] “Shree Krishna imparted Vedic knowledge into the heart of the first-born Brahma.” Thus, he is the supreme spiritual master.
The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:
na tatsamaśhchābhyadhikaśh cha dṛiśhyate (6.8)[v21]
“Nobody is equal to God, nor is anyone superior to him.” Realizing Shree Krishna to be that same Supreme Lord of the Vedas, Arjun is declaring the above attributes regarding him.
