== Translation ==

Arjun said: O Shree Krishna, seeing Your gentle human form (two-armed), I have regained my composure and my mind is restored to normal.


== Commentary ==

Seeing Shree Krishna in his beautiful two-armed form reconfirmed and strengthened Arjun’s sentiment of sakhya bhāv. Thus, Arjun says he has regained his composure and is back to normal. Seeing Shree Krishna’s pastimes with the Pandavas, the celestial sage Narad had earlier told Arjun’s elder brother, King Yudhishthir: gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣhya liṅgam (Bhāgavatam 7.15.75)[v25] “Shree Krishna resides in your house and lives with you just like your brother.” Thus, Arjun was habituated to having the privilege of interacting with the Lord as a brother and friend.
