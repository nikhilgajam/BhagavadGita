== Commentary ==

Virtuous people perform sacrifice to purify the self and to please God. The travesty is that demoniac people also perform sacrifices, but with an impure intent. They do grandiose ritualistic ceremonies so as to look pious in the eyes of society. But they do not adhere to the injunctions of the scriptures, and instead perform sacrifices for personal advertisement and pretentious display. However, the injunction of the scriptures is: gūhitasya bhaved vṛiddhiḥ kīrtitasya bhavet kṣhayaḥ (Mahabharat)[v11] “If we advertise a good deed we have done, its merit decreases; if we keep it secret, its merit multiplies.” In this verse, Shree Krishna dismisses the ritualistic ceremonies of the demoniac by saying that they are incorrectly performed.
