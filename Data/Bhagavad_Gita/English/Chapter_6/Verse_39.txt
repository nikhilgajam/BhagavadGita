== Commentary ==

Doubts arise from ignorance, and the power to dispel doubts comes from knowledge. Scholars of the scriptures possess theoretical knowledge, which is not good enough to dispel doubts, because the scriptures contain many apparent contradictions that can be reconciled only by realization. The God-realized Saints do possess realized knowledge that is limited in extent. They do not become all-knowing. Such realized Saints do possess the power to dispel doubts, but they cannot compete with God, who is all-knowing. God alone is sarvajña (omniscient) and sarva-śhaktimān (all-powerful), and hence he is supremely competent in removing all ignorance, just as the sun is competent in repealing the darkness.
