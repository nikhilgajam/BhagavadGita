== Translation ==

Arjun said: What is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but who does not endeavor sufficiently due to an unsteady mind and is unable to reach the goal of Yog in this life?


== Commentary ==

The journey toward God-realization begins with śhraddhā (faith). Many sincere souls develop faith in the divine knowledge of the scriptures by virtue of the sanskārs of their past lives, or the association of saints, or reversals in the world, etc. There can be many reasons that create the śhraddhā required to begin the journey. However, if these aspirants do not put in the necessary effort and become ayatiḥ (lax), then the mind remains chalit (restless). Such aspirants are unable to complete the journey in this life. Arjun inquires into the fate of such sādhaks.
