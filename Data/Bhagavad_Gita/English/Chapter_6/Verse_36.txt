== Translation ==

Yog is difficult to attain for one whose mind is unbridled. However, those who have learnt to control the mind, and who strive earnestly by proper means, can attain perfection in Yog. This is My opinion.


== Commentary ==

The Supreme Divine Personality, Shree Krishna, now gives the link between the control of the mind and success in Yog. He says that those who have not learnt to bridle the mind through abhyās and vairāgya find great difficulty in the practice of Yog. But those who have brought the mind under their control through persistent effort can achieve success by adopting the proper means. The perfect process has already been described by him from verses 6.10 to 6.32. It includes subduing the senses, giving up all desires, focusing the mind upon God alone, thinking of him with an unwavering mind, and seeing everyone with equal vision.
This statement creates a doubt in Arjun’s mind regarding the sādhak who is unable to control the mind, and he now questions Shree Krishna in this regard.
