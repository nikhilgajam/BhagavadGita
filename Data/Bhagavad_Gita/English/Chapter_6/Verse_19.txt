=== Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 6, Verse 19 ===


यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता |
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युञ्जतो योगमात्मन: || 19 ||

yathā dīpo nivāta-stho neṅgate sopamā smṛitā
yogino yata-chittasya yuñjato yogam ātmanaḥ


== Word Meanings ==

yathā — as
dīpaḥ — a lamp
nivāta-sthaḥ — in a windless place
na — does not
iṅgate — flickers
sā — this
upamā — analogy
smṛitā — is considered
yoginaḥ — of a yogi
yata-chittasya — whose mind is disciplined
yuñjataḥ — steadily practicing
yogam — in meditation
ātmanaḥ — on the Supreme


== Translation ==

Just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker, so the disciplined mind of a yogi remains steady in meditation on the Supreme.


== Commentary ==

In this verse, Shree Krishna gives the simile of the flame of a lamp. In the wind, the flame flickers naturally and is impossible to control. However, in a windless place, the flame becomes as steady as a picture. Similarly, the mind is fickle by nature and very difficult to control. But when the mind of a yogi is in enthralled union with God, it becomes sheltered against the winds of desire. Such a yogi holds the mind steadily under control by the power of devotion.
