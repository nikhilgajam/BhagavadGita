== Commentary ==

During the festival of Diwali in India, shops sell sugar candy molded in various forms, as cars, airplanes, men, women, animals, balls, caps, etc. Children fight with their parents that they want a car, elephant, and so on. The parents smile at their innocuousness, thinking that they are all made from the same sugar ingredient, and are all equally sweet.
Similarly, the ingredient of everything that exists is God himself, in the form of his various energies.
eka deśhasthitasyāgnirjyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā
parasya brahmaṇaḥ śhaktistathedamakhilaṁ jagat (Nārad Pañcharātra)[v22]
“Just as the sun, while remaining in one place, spreads its light everywhere, similarly the Supreme Lord, by his various energies pervades and sustains everything that exists.” The perfected yogis, in the light of realized knowledge, see everything in its connection with God.
