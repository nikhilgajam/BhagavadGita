== Translation ==

The food that people prefer is according to their dispositions. The same is true for the sacrifice, austerity, and charity they are inclined (or predisposed) toward. Now hear of the distinctions from Me.


== Commentary ==

The mind and body impact each other. Thus, the food people eat influences their nature and vice versa. The Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad explains that the coarsest part of the food we eat passes out as feces; the subtler part becomes flesh; and the subtlest part becomes the mind (6.5.1). Again, it states: āhāra śhuddhau sattva śhuddhiḥ  (7.26.2)[v1] “By eating pure food, the mind becomes pure.” The reverse is also true—people with pure minds prefer pure foods.
