Arjun inquired: What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas, O Lord? How do they act? How do they go beyond the bondage of the guṇas?


== Commentary ==

Arjun heard from Shree Krishna about transcending the three guṇas. So, now he asks three questions in relation to the guṇas. The word liṅgais means “symptoms.” His first question is: “What are the symptoms of those who have transcended the three guṇas?” The word āchāraḥ means “conduct.” Arjun’s second question is: “In what manner do such transcendentalists conduct themselves?” The word ativartate means “transcend.” The third question he asks is: “How does one transcend the three guṇas?” Shree Krishna answers his questions systematically.
