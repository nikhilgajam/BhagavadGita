कथयिष्यन्ति तेऽव्ययाम् |

akīrtiṁ chāpi bhūtāni
kathayiṣhyanti te ’vyayām
sambhāvitasya chākīrtir
maraṇād atirichyate


== Word Meanings ==

akīrtim — infamy
cha — and
api — also
bhūtāni — people
kathayiṣhyanti — will speak
te — of your
avyayām — everlasting
sambhāvitasya — of a respectable person

akīrtiḥ — infamy
maraṇāt — than death
atirichyate — is greater


== Translation ==

People will speak of you as a coward and a deserter. For a respectable person, infamy is worse than death.


== Commentary ==

For respectable people, social prestige is very important. The particular guṇas (modes of nature) of warriors make respect and honor especially important for them. For them, dishonor is worse than death. Shree Krishna reminds Arjun of this, so that if he is not inspired by superior knowledge, he may at least be inspired by inferior knowledge.
Many societies in the world observe the norm that a warrior who runs away from the battlefield out of cowardice is ostracized from society. That could be the extent of dishonor inflicted upon Arjun if he avoided his duty.
