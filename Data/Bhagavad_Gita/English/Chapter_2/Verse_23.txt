Weapons cannot shred the soul, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it.


== Commentary ==

Consciousness, which is the symptom of the soul, can be perceived by material instruments, but the soul itself cannot be contacted by any material object. This is so only because the soul is divine, and hence beyond the interactions of material objects. Shree Krishna expresses this vividly by saying that wind cannot wither the soul, nor can water moisten it or fire burn it.
