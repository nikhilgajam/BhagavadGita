== Commentary ==

In this verse, Shree Krishna says that there are four categories of people who do not surrender to Him:
1. The Ignorant. People who lack spiritual knowledge and do not know anything about the soul being eternal and that its ultimate goal is God-realization. They have never heard about these concepts or aware of the process of surrendering to God.
2. The lazy. These are the ones who have the knowledge and awareness of what they need to do still, due to their lazy-nature do not want to take any initiative to surrender. Laziness can be a big pitfall for someone on the path of spirituality. There is a Sanskrit saying:
ālasya hī manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥnāstyudyamasamo bandhuḥ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati
“Laziness is a big enemy, and it resides; in our body itself.  Work is a good friend of humans, which never leads to downfall.”
3. Deluded Intellects. People who are so proud of their intellects that they have no faith in the scriptures and the teachings of the saints. Because they do not have faith, they are unable to practice surrender or understand the concepts of God-realization.
4. Demonic Nature. These are the people who are aware of God and His purpose for the world but still work against Him.  It is because of their demonic nature; they do not like God and His glories. They themselves are far from devotion and try to disturb others who are on the path of spirituality. Surrender to God is not at all expected from them.
