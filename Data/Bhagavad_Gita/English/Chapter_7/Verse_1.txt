== Commentary ==

While concluding the previous chapter, Shree Krishna stated that the best yogis are those who exclusively focus on God and serve Him with great dedication. This gives rise to a few questions, such as, how can one get to know the Supreme Lord? How should a devotee worship Him and meditate upon Him?
Although Arjun had not asked these questions, yet the Omniscient and kind Lord began to answer. Here, Shree Krishna has used the terms mad-āśhrayaḥ, meaning “with your mind focused on Me” and śhṛiṇu, which means “listen.” He is asking Arjun to listen to Him attentively.
