But the fruit gained by these people of little understanding is perishable. Those who worship the celestial gods go to the celestial abodes, while My devotees come to Me.


== Commentary ==

Continuing from the previous verses, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun the spiritual principle that is: “One attains the object of one’s worship. People who worship the devatās go to the planets of the respective devatās upon death. Whereas, those who are devoted to me come to my abode.”  Now, the question comes up again, when reaching God is the ultimate destination, then why does God steady the faith of those devotees who worship the celestial gods?
Consider the example of our education system, where students start with primary school but cannot stay at that level forever. The teachers encourage them and coach them to move to the next level. Even though primary school is necessary, students outgrow that and keep moving higher and higher. Similarly, the Bhagavad Gita is not for the primary school students or the novices who wish to attain the celestial abodes. But for those devotees who are seeking a higher purpose.
Since the devatās are perishable, the fruits they bestow on their devotees are also perishable. However, God is imperishable, and the fruits of his worship are also ever-lasting. Those who worship the eternal form of God, upon death, attain His eternal abode and stay there forever in His service.
