== Translation ==

Arjun said: O Supreme Lord, what is Brahman (Absolute Reality), what is adhyatma (the individual soul), and what is karma? What is said to be adhibhuta, and who is said to be Adhidaiva? Who is Adhiyajna in the body and how is He the Adhiyajna? O Krishna, how are You to be known at the time of death by those of steadfast mind?


== Commentary ==

Toward the end of the previous chapter, Shree Krishna had mentioned a few words like Brahman, adhibhuta, adhiyatma, adhidaiva, and adhiyajna. Also, that the enlightened souls are in full consciousness of Him even at the time of their death. Hearing this, Arjun is curious and wants to know more. In these two verses, he puts forth to Shree Krishna seven questions, out of which six are about these words, and the seventh question is regarding remembering God at the time of death. Since Shree Krishna had Himself introduced these subjects, Arjun wants Him to elaborate upon them.
