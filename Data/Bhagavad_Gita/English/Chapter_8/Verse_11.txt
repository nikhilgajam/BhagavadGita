== Commentary ==

In the Vedas, God is referred by many names: Brahman, Bhagwan, Deva, Paramātmā, Praṇa, Puruṣh, Sat, etc. In some places, while referring to His formless aspect, God is said to be Akshar, which means imperishable. The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:
etasya vā akṣharasya praśhāsane gārgisūryāchandramasau vidhṛitau tiṣhṭhataḥ   (3.8.9)
“Under the mighty control of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon are held on their course.”
Shree Krishna mentions in this verse the word sangraheṇa, which means “in brief.” He says that this path is very difficult to follow and not suitable for everyone. Therefore, He will not elaborate much and briefly describe this path of yog-miśhrā bhakti; that leads to attaining the formless aspect of God. It demands living a life of rigid continence and perform severe austerities. Renouncing worldly desires and practicing brahmacharya, a vow of celibacy. As was previously detailed in verse 6.14, the practice of celibacy conserves a person’s physical energy. This energy, when channelized through sadhana, gets transformed into spiritual energy. It also enhances the intellect and memory power of the sādhaks (spiritual aspirants) and helps them comprehend the spiritual subjects better.
