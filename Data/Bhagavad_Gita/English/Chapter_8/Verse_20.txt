Transcendental to this manifest and unmanifest creation, there is yet another unmanifest eternal dimension.  That realm does not cease even when all others do.


== Commentary ==

So far, Shree Krishna revealed the material worlds and their temporary nature. He now starts describing the eternal spiritual realm, which He says is beyond these material worlds and everlasting. The spiritual realm does not dissolute along with the material realms in the cycle of creation. The eternal world is created by Yogmaya, the spiritual energy of God. Later in verse 10.42, He reveals that only one-fourth of His entire creation is in the material dimension, and the remaining three-fourth is the eternal spiritual world.
