== Commentary ==

God, situated within the heart of the living being as the Supreme Soul, never identifies with the body, nor is affected by its states of existence.  His presence in the material body does not make Him material in any way, nor is He subject to the law of karma and the cycle of birth and death, though these are experienced by the soul.
