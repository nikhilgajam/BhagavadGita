== Commentary ==

In His customary style, Shree Krishna now winds up the topic of the field and the knower of the field by summing up all that He has said.  True knowledge is to know the distinction between the material kṣhetra (field of activity) and the spiritual kṣhetrajña (knower of the field).  Those possessing such discriminative knowledge do not look upon themselves as the material body.  They identify with their spiritual nature as souls and tiny parts of God.  Hence, they seek the path of spiritual elevation and release from material nature.  Then, by treading on the path of spiritual enlightenment, such persons of wisdom attain their ultimate goal of God-realization.
