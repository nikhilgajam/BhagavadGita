== Commentary ==

Yudhisthtira, the eldest Pandava is being addressed here as “King.” He always displayed royal grace and nobility, whether living in a palace or in a forest when in exile. He also got this title by performing the Rājasūya Yajña a royal sacrifice, which earned him tributes from all the other kings of the world.
In this verse, Sanjay also called Dhritarashtra the “Ruler of the earth.” The real reason for this appellation was to remind him of his duties as the ruler of the country. With so many kings and princes participating from both sides in this war, it was as if the entire earth was split into two parties. It was definite that this mammoth war would cause irreversible destruction. The only person who could stop the war at this juncture was Dhritarashtra, and Sanjay wanted to know if he was willing to do that.
